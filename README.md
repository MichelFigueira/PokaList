## About

This simple project to practice everything I learned about Angular and also a little bit of .NET Core / C#.<br>
I started the project when I started my studies, so there may be some bugs and bad code :worried:
<br><br>
When I have time, I try to improve and perfect the project.

## How to use

I split the project into two parts:

### Front-end

I initially used Angular 11 where I recently migrated to 13.<br>
As a help, I used a template coded by [Creative Tim][creativetim].<br>
<b>[Github front-end project][frontend]</b>

### Back-end

I used .NET Core 5 with EF Core and MySQL.<br>
<b>[Github back-end project][backend]</b>
